## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and cache's its mean.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
## 1.set the value of the matrix
## 2.get the value of the matrix
## 3.set the value of the inverse
## 4.get the value of the inverse


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inverse)
    m <<- inverse
  getinv <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(m)
  m
}
